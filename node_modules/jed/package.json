Miller\n\nThe sprintf implementation is from:\n\n* Alexandru Marasteanu <alexaholic [at) gmail (dot] com>\n\n\n## The name\n\nThe name jed.js is an homage to Jed Schmidt (<https://github.com/jed>) the JavaScript community member who is a japanese translator by day, and a \"hobbyist\" JavaScript programmer by night.
