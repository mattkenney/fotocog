This Master Privacy Policy (&#8220;Privacy Policy&#8221;) explains the collection,
use, and disclosure of &#8220;personal information&#8221; by Fotocog.com. This
Privacy Policy includes products and services provided through websites that
Fotocog.com operates.</p>

<p>In addition, additional or supplemental Privacy Policy terms (&#8220;Supplemental
Privacy Policy Terms&#8221;) may apply to a particular Website or service provided
thereon. All such Supplemental Privacy Policy Terms will be accessible for you to
read either within, or through your use of, that Website or service.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy also explains our commitment to you with respect to our use
and disclosure of non personal browsing and site usage data that Fotocog.com collects
as the provider of the Websites. That commitment is contained in a &#8220;Data Usage
Policy,&#8221; below.</p>

<p>As used in this policy, &#8220;personal information&#8221; means information that
would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or
location, telephone number or email address.</p>

<p>By accessing the Websites, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices
described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><a name="principles"></a></p>

<h2>Our Principles</h2>

<p>Fotocog.com is committed to handling responsibly the information and data we
collect about you through our Websites, whether personal information or non personal
browsing and site usage data. We have designed our Privacy Policy and our Data Usage
Policy consistent with the following principles (the &#8220;Principles&#8221;):</p>

<ol>
<li>Privacy policies and data collection and use policies should be human readable,
comprehensive, and easy to locate;</li>

<li>Only the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to provide you with
services should be collected and maintained, and only for so long as reasonably
needed or required;</li>

<li>Information you provide through our Websites, or that we gather as a result of
your use of our Websites, should not be used for marketing or advertising purposes,
nor should it be provided voluntarily (without your permission) to anyone else
unless required; and</li>

<li>Unless restricted or prohibited by law, and provided your email address has
been collected and retained, you should be notified when circumstances require
Fotocog.com to provide a third party with your personal information.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="personalinfo"></a></p>

<h2>Personal Information Fotocog.com Collects</h2>

<p>We may collect personal information at several places on the Websites, including
without limitation:</p>

<ul>
<li>when you register to establish a user account on any of our Websites;</li>

<li>when you provide us with your personal information such as by sending an email
to us;</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="forwhat"></a></p>

<h2>What Fotocog.com does with Personal Information</h2>

<p><strong>Registered Users.</strong> When you register to obtain a user account on
any of the Websites (any such person, a &#8220;Registered User&#8221;), you may be
asked to provide personal information to create your account and establish a password
and profile. If you do provide your email address, it will allow us to send you your
password if you should forget it. If you voluntarily provide your real name in
connection with any content you submit to any Website, your name may be associated
with the content you contributed. We will also use that personal information to
establish and maintain your membership and provide you with the features we provide
for Registered Users, and for the purpose of contacting you about upcoming news and
events relevant to Fotocog.com.</p>

<p>Any other personal information that we may collect which is not described
specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and used in accordance
with the Principles.</p>

<p><a name="disclosures"></a></p>

<h2>Disclosures of Personal Information</h2>

<p>In general, it is not Fotocog.com&#8217;s practice to disclose personal
information to third parties. We may share personal information in two instances:</p>

<p>First, Fotocog.com may share personal information with our contractors and service
providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the
Websites.</p>

<p>Second, we may disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith
belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding
suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Master Terms of Use and
Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena,
statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that
of our users, affiliates, or the public.</p>

<p>If Fotocog.com is required to provide a third party with your personal information
(whether by subpoena or otherwise), then provided we have collected and retained an
email address for you, Fotocog.com will use reasonable means to notify you promptly
of that event, unless prohibited by law or Fotocog.com is otherwise advised not to
notify you on the advice of legal counsel.</p>

<p><a name="security"></a></p>

<h2>Security of Personal Information Collected via the Websites</h2>

<p>Fotocog.com has implemented reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized
access to and unlawful interception or processing of personal information that
Fotocog.com stores and controls. However, no website can fully eliminate security
risks. Third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or
access transmissions or private communications. We will post a reasonably prominent
notice to the Websites if any such security breach occurs.</p>

<p><a name="datausage"></a></p>

<h2>Data Usage Policy: Non Personal Browsing and Site Usage Information</h2>

<p>Our Data Usage Policy covers how we maintain and use information about you that is
collected by our Websites and server logs.</p>

<p><strong>Non Personal Browsing Information We Collect</strong>. When you use the
Websites, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may
collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of
your &#8220;IP address&#8221;) about your activities while visiting the Websites and
information about the browser you are using.</p>

<p><strong>No Linking</strong>. We do not intentionally link browsing information to
the personal information you submit to us. We use this information for internal
purposes only, such as to help understand how the Websites are being used, to improve
our Websites and the features we provide, and for systems administration purposes.
Fotocog.com may use a third party analytics provider to help us collect and analyze
non personal browsing information through operation of our Websites for those same
purposes.</p>

<p><strong>No Selling or Sharing</strong>. Except in the unique situations identified
in this Privacy Policy, Fotocog.com does not sell or otherwise voluntarily provide
the non personal browsing information we collect about you or your website usage to
third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Notice</strong>. If Fotocog.com is required to provide a third party with
your non personal browsing information (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then
Fotocog.com will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless
Fotocog.com is prohibited by law from doing so or is otherwise advised not to notify
you on the advice of legal counsel.</p>

<p>Any other non-personal information that we collect which is not described
specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and used in accordance
with the Principles.</p>

<p><a name="spinoffs"></a></p>

<h2>Reorganization or Spin-Offs</h2>

<p>Fotocog.com may transfer some or all of your personal and/or non personal browsing
information to a third party as a result of a reorganization, spin-off or similar
transaction. Upon such transfer, the acquirer&#8217;s privacy policy will apply. In
such event, Fotocog.com will use reasonable efforts to notify you and to ensure that
at the time of the transaction the acquirer&#8217;s privacy policy complies with the
Principles.</p>

<p><a name="children"></a></p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>The Websites are not directed at children under the age of 13. Consistent with the
federal Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never
knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without
requiring parental consent. Our <a href="termsofuse.html">Master Terms of Use</a>
specifically prohibit anyone using our Websites from submitting any personally
identifiable information about persons under 13 years of age. Any person who provides
their personal information to Fotocog.com through the Websites represents that they
are 13 years of age or older.</p>

<p><a name="3rdparties"></a></p>

<h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>

<p>The Websites may include links to other websites. You should consult the
respective privacy policies of these third-party sites. This Privacy Policy does not
apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites.</p>

<p><a name="internationalusers"></a></p>

<h2>Special Note to International Users</h2>

<p>The Websites are hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Websites
from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing
personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from United States laws,
please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which
does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and other regions. By providing
your personal data you consent to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with
the Privacy Policy; and</li>

<li>the transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated
above.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="changes"></a></p>

<h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise
the Effective Date below. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy
to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect.
Your continued use of the Websites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy
and any updates.</p>
